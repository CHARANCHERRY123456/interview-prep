1. Core Java (Basics)

These are the building blocks:

Java Syntax & Basics ✅

Variables & Data Types ✅

Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise) ✅

Control Flow (if-else, switch, loops) ✅

Type casting (implicit/explicit) ✅

OOP Concepts

Classes & Objects ✅

Constructors (default, parameterized, copy) ✅
 -- default is empty parameters , parameterized means just have parameters , copy means overloading

Inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical) ✅
Single: One child ← One parent
Multilevel: GrandParent → Parent → Child
Hierarchical: One parent → Multiple children
Polymorphism (compile-time → method overloading, runtime → method overriding) ✅

Abstraction (abstract classes, interfaces) ✅

Encapsulation (getters & setters) ✅

this & super keywords ✅

final keyword (classes, methods, variables) ✅

    Variable	Value cannot change	final int MAX = 100;
    Method	Cannot be overridden	final void show() { }
    Class	Cannot be subclassed	final class MyClass { }

Java Methods & Scope
  Local Variables: Declared inside a method; accessible only within that method.
  Instance Variables: Declared in class but outside methods; accessible by all instance methods of the class.also in sub class
  Static Variables: Declared with static; accessible by all objects and class methods.

Method definition, parameters, return types ✅

Method overloading ✅

Recursion ✅

Packages & Import ✅
  Packages in Java are namespaces that group related classes and interfaces together. They help:
    Avoid name conflicts
    Organize code better
    Control access with modifiers
  Types of Packages:
    Built-in Packages – Provided by Java, e.g., java.util, java.io
    User-defined Packages – Created by programmers to organize their code

java.lang, java.util, java.io basics
  Java Built-in Packages – Quick Revision
  java.lang
  Automatically imported in every Java program.
  Contains fundamental classes:
  String, StringBuilder, Math, Integer, Double, Object, System
  Provides core functionality like strings, math operations, wrappers, and system operations.
  java.util
  Contains utility classes for data structures, collections, and date/time.
  Key classes:
  ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet, Date, Calendar, Collections
  Used for collections, random numbers, formatting, and algorithms.
  java.io
  Used for input and output operations, mainly file handling.
  Key classes:
  File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter
  Supports reading/writing files, streams, and serialization.

  
Custom packages ✅
  A custom package is a package created by the programmer to organize related classes and interfaces.

  
2. Core Java (Intermediate)

Strings & StringBuilder/StringBuffer ✅

Immutable vs mutable

Common methods (substring, indexOf, split, etc.)

Arrays

Single-dimensional & multi-dimensional

Basic algorithms (reverse, search, max/min)

Collections Framework

List (ArrayList, LinkedList)

Set (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)

Map (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap)

Queue & Deque (PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque)

Iterators & enhanced for loop

Sorting & Comparators

Generics : https://youtu.be/w54ikax6Ic8?si=rmdtmeqe6fWfksCi

Generic classes, methods, bounded types

Wildcards (? extends, ? super)

Exception Handling

try-catch-finally

Checked vs unchecked exceptions

Custom exceptions

throw vs throws

Enums & Annotations

Enum types

Custom and built-in annotations (@Override, @Deprecated) learn it in side

3. Advanced Java

File I/O & Serialization

File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter

Object serialization (Serializable interface)

Java Concurrency & Multithreading

Thread class, Runnable interface

Thread lifecycle & states

Synchronization & locks

Executor framework

Callable, Future, CountDownLatch, Semaphore

Java 8+ Features

Lambda expressions

Functional interfaces (@FunctionalInterface)

Streams API (filter, map, reduce, collect)

Optional class

Method references

Java Memory Management

Stack vs Heap

Garbage collection

finalize(), weak references

JVM Internals

JVM architecture

Class loading

JIT compilation

4. Java Design & Patterns

Singleton, Factory, Builder, Observer

Strategy, Adapter, Decorator

MVC basics

5. Database & Networking (Optional but useful for interviews)

JDBC (CRUD operations)

PreparedStatement vs Statement

Transactions

Networking basics (Socket, ServerSocket)

6. Testing & Tools

JUnit (unit testing)

Logging (java.util.logging / Log4j)

Maven/Gradle basics
