Integrity Constraints 

In DBMS, integrity constraints are rules that ensure the accuracy, consistency, and validity of data stored in a database.
They act like guardrails: whenever you insert, update, or delete data, these rules prevent invalid or inconsistent data from entering the database.

🧩 Why Integrity Constraints Matter

Data Accuracy: Prevents wrong or meaningless data (e.g., negative age).

Consistency: Maintains valid relationships between tables.

Reliability: Ensures the database reflects real-world rules.

✅ Types of Integrity Constraints

1️⃣ Domain Constraints

Ensure that a column’s value is from a valid set of values (data type, range, format).

Enforced by: NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT, data types.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Student (
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 0 AND Age <= 120)
);

➜ Age must be between 0 and 120.



---

2️⃣ Entity Integrity

Every row must be uniquely identifiable.

Enforced by: PRIMARY KEY.

Rules:

Primary key cannot be NULL.

Primary key must be unique.


Example:

CREATE TABLE Student (
    RollNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50)
);



---

3️⃣ Referential Integrity

Maintains valid relationships between two tables (foreign keys).

A foreign key in a child table must match a primary key in the parent table, or be NULL (if allowed).

Prevents:

Orphan records (child without parent).

Deleting parent rows if child rows depend on them (unless ON DELETE rules are set).


CREATE TABLE Department (
    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Department(DeptID)
);



---

4️⃣ Key Constraints

Ensure that certain columns (candidate keys) are unique across rows.

Types:

Primary Key: One per table.

Unique Key: Can be multiple; NULL allowed unless specified.


CREATE TABLE User (
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);



---

5️⃣ Check Constraints

Custom conditions that must be true for each row.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    Quantity INT CHECK (Quantity > 0),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (Price >= 0)
);



---

6️⃣ NOT NULL Constraint

Ensures a column cannot store NULL (must have a value).

CREATE TABLE Student (
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);



---

7️⃣ Default Constraint

Assigns a default value if no value is provided.

CREATE TABLE Student (
    Status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'Active'
);



---

🔑 Key Points to Remember

Order of enforcement: Domain → Entity → Referential.

Integrity constraints are checked automatically by the DBMS during INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

They ensure logical correctness of data without extra application code.

🗂 Interview Summary Answer

> Integrity constraints are rules that maintain the correctness and consistency of database data.
Major types include:

Domain (valid data types/ranges),

Entity (primary key non-null & unique),

Referential (valid foreign key references),

Key (uniqueness), along with CHECK, NOT NULL, and DEFAULT.
They protect the database from invalid operations and keep relationships accurate.
