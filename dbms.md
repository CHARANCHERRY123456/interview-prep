Here’s a concise, theory-only summary of database **normalization up to 5NF**:

---

**Normalization**
Process of organizing data into well-structured tables to remove redundancy and avoid update, insert, and delete anomalies.

---

### 1NF (First Normal Form)

* All attributes contain **atomic (indivisible)** values.
* No repeating groups or arrays inside a single column.

### 2NF (Second Normal Form)

* Table is in 1NF.
* **No partial dependency**: every non-key attribute depends on the **whole** of every candidate key (not just part of a composite key).

### 3NF (Third Normal Form)

* Table is in 2NF.
* **No transitive dependency**: non-key attributes depend **only on candidate keys**, not on other non-key attributes.

### BCNF (Boyce–Codd Normal Form)

* Stricter version of 3NF.
* For every functional dependency X → Y, **X must be a candidate key**.

### 4NF (Fourth Normal Form)

* Table is in BCNF.
* **No multi-valued dependencies**: independent multi-valued facts are separated into different tables.
    ➡ 4NF says: If two sets of facts are independent, keep them in separate tables.
  ex : A -> BC and B,C are not dependent then split them

### 5NF (Fifth Normal Form)

* Table is in 4NF.
* **No join dependency**: table cannot be decomposed further without losing information; all data can be reconstructed from smaller tables without redundancy.
➡ 5NF says: Break tables so that no hidden “join” relationships cause duplication.

---

**Goal:** stepwise elimination of redundancy and anomalies while preserving data integrity.




### **Indexing – Quick Revision**

**Goal:** Speed up data retrieval by avoiding full table scans.

---

### 1️⃣ What is an Index

* A **data structure** (stored separately) that maps key values → row locations.
* Think of it as a book’s back-of-the-book index.

---

### 2️⃣ Types

* **Primary/Clustered**:

  * Sorting of table data matches the index order.
  * One per table (because data itself is stored in that order).
* **Secondary/Non-clustered**:

  * Separate structure holding key + pointer (row ID).
  * Multiple allowed.

---

### 3️⃣ Common Structures

* **B+ Tree**: Balanced tree; great for range queries.
* **Hash Index**: Fast equality lookups (=), not good for ranges.
* Others: Bitmap (for low-cardinality columns), Full-Text, etc.

---

### 4️⃣ Operations

* **Lookup:** Use index to jump directly to rows.
* **Insert/Update/Delete:** Must also update index → slightly slower writes.

---

### 5️⃣ Guidelines

* Index columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`.
* Avoid over-indexing—each extra index costs space & maintenance.

---

**Essence:**
An index is a separate, sorted (or hashed) structure that accelerates reads at the expense of extra storage and write overhead.
